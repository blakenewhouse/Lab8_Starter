1. Graceful degradation and service workers are related because service workers help your website still work when the internet is slow or not available, while graceful degradation means your site should still do something useful even if some parts break. Service workers do this by saving files like HTML, CSS, and data so your site can load from the cache instead of the internet. This helps the site not break completely when the network is bad.
